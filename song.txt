She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (oh-oh), hey-ey
